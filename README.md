# Data-Science-Assignment-Credit-Card-Customer-Analysis

### Problem Statement: 
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the "Credit Card Customers" dataset. The financial industry relies heavily on understanding customer behavior and making data-driven decisions to improve customer experience, manage risk, and enhance profitability. Credit card companies, in particular, need to analyze their customer base to identify key trends, segment customers based on their usage patterns, and predict potential customer behaviors. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and build a predictive model that aids in customer segmentation and behavioral predictions.

### Dataset Understanding:
#### Dataset Description:
* Customer demographics: Age, gender, education level, marital status, income category.
* Customer behavior: Months on book, total relationship count, months inactive, contacts count, credit limit, average open to buy, total transactions, and average utilization ratio.
* Target variable: Attrition flag (whether the customer has churned or not).

#### Data Preprocessing

* Data Shape: The dataset consists of 10127 rows and 23 columns.
* Data Types: The dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical variables.
* Missing Values: No missing values were found.
* Feature Selection: Two irrelevant columns ('Naive Bayes Classifier Attrition Flag Card Category Contacts Count 12 mon Dependent count Education Level Months Inactive 12 mon 1' and 'Naive Bayes Classifier Attrition Flag Card Category Contacts Count 12 mon Dependent count Education Level Months Inactive 12 mon 2') were dropped.
